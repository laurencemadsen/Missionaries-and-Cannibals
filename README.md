# Missionaries and Cannibals
Missionaries and Cannibals is a logic based game in which you need to move both missionaries and cannibals to the opposite bank of a river without ever having more cannibals than missionaries on either side, but you can only move one at a time. The tests were provided as part of the assignment.

## Running the Tests

With your working directory set to the one containing your Go sources, you can simply run:
```
go test
```
And several unit tests against your `valid()` and `successors()` functions will be run.
